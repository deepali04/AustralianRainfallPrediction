# AustralianRainfallPrediction

Rainfall is a significant meteorological event that can affect local agriculture, transportation, water control, and more. It may be even more consequential for areas that experience relatively less rainfall than the rest of the world, such as cities and towns in Australia. The ability to accurately forecast rainfall could provide useful information to local government and industry, especially in a world feeling the effects of climate change.

The study will enable us to predict whether or not a location in Australia will experience rain tomorrow using the weather observation data. Given a set of features, we want to predict the target variable RainTomorrow as, 1 which shows either it will rain the next day or 0 which shows it will not rain the next day.
